# eXPlainability supported by Mixtures of Experts

### How to Use This Table

1. **Identify Relevant Strategies**: Each row links a **dimension of FMOps** with a recommended **explainability technique**. This helps teams pick and choose suitable methods based on the nature of their MoE setup.

2. **Integrate into MoE**: Focus on how each strategy interacts with the **Mixture of Experts** gating and expert modules, ensuring every new or existing expert can generate interpretable outputs.

3. **Continuous Improvement**: Reference the rows (e.g., #8 for “Error Handling”) to systematically enhance your pipeline’s explainability, from selection gating to final decision, over the model’s lifecycle.
